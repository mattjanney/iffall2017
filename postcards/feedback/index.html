			Critique of Maddy Mueller's Postcard Mockups

			<p>The designs themselves are striking in how funny they are, although I think the legibility could be improved in certain spots. It could be interesting to try to italicize/underline/bold the type in a few different spots to give the viewer an idea of what that quote sounded like when it was said. For instance, "I don't want to be married anymore" could be bolded somewhere since she was probably yelling it.</p>
			<p>The focal point seems to be on Kim K each time which seems quite fitting as a design choice. I think you may run into some trouble in the one of Kim/Kanye on the red carpet one since Kanye's suit is pretty much the only place to put the type for it to be legible. I noticed almost all of the text is in the bottom of your designs--maybe experiment with a couple different placements. <br> The image quality seems fine to me
			except for the "I don't want to be married" one in the phone format might be a little too pixelated.  Last thing-In the "your sister is going to jail" one, maybe try moving the text up from Kim's shirt to the bit of white wall behind her.
