				Hedi Slimane is a French photographer and fashion designer, most well-known for
				his controversial time as creative director at Yves Saint Laurent.
				The Frenchman began his career as an assistant in fashion marketing at Yves Saint
				Laurent in the 1990s, quickly rising through the ranks to become a designer, before
				he shot to prominence following his creative directorship of Dior Homme, and his
				popularisation of a skinny silhouette in menswear.
				In 2012, he returned to Saint Laurent to helm the brand's womenswear and
				menswear labels. In his four years in the position, Slimane's creative
				directorship divided opinion, but his LA youth culture-driven
				collections commanded the attention of the global fashion industry and drove stellar
				financial results. In April 2016, it was announced that Slimane would be exiting the
				storied Parisian house.

				<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Bringing Back Rocker Chic</b><br>
				Ever fond of music and youth subcultures, the designer painted an edgier, younger and
				more accessible picture over the otherwise traditionally formal label. Rock ‘n’ roll would
				resonate in nearly all aspects of his work; from his blaring underground catwalk
				soundtracks, to his continuous rehashing of subcultural trends (rockabilly biker jackets,
				grungy tattered knitwear, dazzling, glam rock-inspired prints etc).<br><br>

				<b>Blurring the Gender Lines With Unisex Silhouettes</b><br>
				Slimane has also been regarded as a purveyor of gender fluidity in his designs. Slimane
				saw a distinct merger between male and female silhouettes, characterized by vacuumsealed
				trousers, waifish suits cut with high armholes and narrow sleeves and the
				occasional skinny tie.<br><br>

				<b>Dropping the “Yves”</b><br>
				Slimane swiftly kickstarted his rebranding of the storied French house by scandalously
				axing the label’s forename, Yves, and changing its font into something bolder and more
				modern.<br><br>

				<b>Relocating to L.A</b><br>
				After taking the reins at Saint Laurent, Slime moved the French house far from its Parisian
				ateliers to the sunny SoCal city. An action that was a watershed moment for the fashion
				industry, putting the City of Angels on the style map like never before.<br><br>

				<b>Reintroducing Couture</b><br>
				In 2015, Slimane relaunched Yves Saint Laurent Couture after the house parted ways with
				the division 10 years prior. Slimane was not only designing the line, but he carefully
				plucked out which lucky glitterati would be worthy enough to wear his custom creations.

				<h1>Slimane In Fashion</h1>
				From 1992 to 1995, Slimane assisted fashion consultant Jean-Jacques Picart on the
				centenary of the project "monogram canvas" of Louis Vuitton. The project invited seven
				fashion designers—Azzedine Alaia, Helmut Lang, Sybilla, Manolo Blahnik, Isaac
				Mizrahi, Romeo Gigli, and Vivienne Westwood—to reinterpret the monogram canvas in
				celebration of its longevity.<br>
				In 1996, Pierre Bergé installed Slimane in the position of ready-to-wear director of men's
				collections at Yves Saint Laurent and later he became artistic director. After the Black Tie
				collection for autumn-winter 2000–01, which foreshadowed the advent of Slimane's
				silhouette, and the debuts of "skinny," he chose to leave YSL, declined the offer of creative
				directorship at Jil Sander, and accepted the position of creative director
				for menswear at Christian Dior. In April 2002, Hedi Slimane was the first menswear
				designer to receive the CFDA award for International Designer.<br>
				He dressed female celebrities including Madonna and Nicole Kidman during his tenure at
				Dior. He furthermore created stagewear for groups such as The Libertines, Daft
				Punk, Franz Ferdinand, and The Kills, and artists such as Mick Jagger, Beck, and Jack
				White.<br>
				Slimane commissioned original soundtracks for his runway shows for Dior Homme,
				created usually by emerging avant-garde artists.
				Slimane did not renew his contract at Dior Homme, and instead returned to fashion and
				portrait photography. In March 2012, Slimane replaced Stefano Pilati as creative director at
				Yves Saint Laurent.

				<h1>Slimane In Art + Photography</h1>
				Immediately after leaving Yves Saint Laurent in 2000, Slimane moved to Berlin, where,
				upon the invitation by curator Klaus Biesenbach, he took up a residency at the KunstWerke
				Institute for Contemporary Art between 2000 and 2002.[3] Berlin, a selection of
				black and white photographs published by Editions 7L/Steidl with Karl
				Lagerfeldand Steidl in 2002, was Slimane's first book documenting the Berlin scene.
				[9] Stage, published by Steidl in 2004, is his second book published on the rock revival and
				the 2.0 generation. Also in 2004, Slimane created the album cover for the band Phoenix's
				album Alphabetical.
				In May 2006, Hedi Slimane created the photographic blog Hedi Slimane Diary. Slimane
				created his Rock Diary, beginning in 2004 in collaboration with the British journalist
				from NME, Alex Needham. In addition, he shot spreads for magazines including
				French Vogue, VMAN, and Purple. When Slimane left for America and based himself in Los
				Angeles in 2007, California became the subject of many of his images and later the subject
				of several exhibitions.
				In 2011, he curated "Myths and Legends of Los Angeles" a group show of Californian
				artists, at Almine Rech Gallery in Paris and Brussels. His own work was shown in 2011 at
				the MOCA, where Slimane presented a photographic installation that showcased an
				archive of images from his California period. The exhibition, titled "California Song", was
				created in a kinematics way, accompanied by a soundtrack by the musical group No Age.

						<h1>Slimane's Favorite Bands</h1><br><br>
						Music is integral to Slimane’s work, and he is focused on both up-and-coming acts as he
						is on global superstars. Among the groups loved by Slimane, there’s a marked constant:
						an artfully disheveled nonchalance and a sound that veers into post-punk psychedelia.
						Find 10 of his most referenced bands below:
